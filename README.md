=====================

## What is ARM [DesignStart](https://developer.arm.com/products/designstart)?

Arm DesignStart helps companies to develop innovative custom chips or FPGA designs,
with the lowest risk possible and with an accelerated time-to-market. No matter
a company’s budget or design expertise, application-specific designs are achievable
and accessible.

## Advantages:

1. Fully functional ARM processor with CoreSight debugging subsystem developed by ARM
2. Pre-built AHB/APB interconnect and ARM-developed peripheries
3. Portable RTL code for almost any FPGA board
4. Firmware examples

## Disadvantages:

1. Processor and CoreSight subsystem RTL obfuscated by ARM
2. System interconnect cannot be changed because the tool used for code generation (Socrat) is not available
3. This ARM source code cannot be used for the commercial usage accordingly with the ARM license agreement
